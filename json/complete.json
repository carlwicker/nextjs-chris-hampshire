He is one of only a small group of producers with genuine cross genre appeal with successful projects in house, progressive, techno, hard dance and trance. Many of these were produced in his own studio including the 1996 release “Breathless” which, helped by a classic remix by Tony De Vit, went on to sell over 40,000 vinyl units. As an artist he has an impressive discography including remixes by and for Tiesto, Sinead O’Conner, Satoshi Tomiie and Tony De Vit. He has also released and licensed original tracks on some of the world’s biggest independent dance imprints including Tommy Boy, Blackhole and Armada Music."

He has taken the famous ‘Recoverworld Live’ brand all over the world and regularly features as a guest mixer on various dance stations including “Recoverworld Radio” which has now been broadcasting for over 20 years….

In 2002 he closed that chapter with the critically acclaimed mix album ‘Harder, Faster, Deeper’. Having signed to Eve Records in 2001, Chris formed a relationship which would ultimately see him acquire the company in 2004. He now presides over a suite of labels under the RecoverWorld banner and has helped launch the careers of John O’Callaghan, John Askew, Sean Tyas, Thomas Datt, Manuel le Saux and many more."
