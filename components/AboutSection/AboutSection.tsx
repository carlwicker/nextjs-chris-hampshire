          releases. He is one of only a small group of producers with genuine

          classic remix by Tony De Vit, went on to sell over 40,000 vinyl units.

          As a DJ, his career has mirrored that of his productions - eclectic
          and always one step ahead of the game. With over 20 years behind the
          decks, he has played as far afield as Japan, South Africa and
          Australia together with regular European and UK dates. He has taken
          the famous ‘Recoverworld Live’ brand all over the world and regularly
          features as a guest mixer on various dance stations including
          “Recoverworld Radio” which has now been broadcasting for over 20
          years…. In 2007 he released the mix album Dark Sessions which became
          Album of the Month in Mixmag and prompted Dj Mag to say, “this is
          trance at its most gorgeous”.
